1. Right-click on DRAM.exe
2. Select "Pin to taskbar"
3. Done!

METHOD 2: Use the shortcut creator
-----------------------------------
1. Double-click "pin-to-taskbar.bat"
2. A DRAM.lnk shortcut will be created
3. Right-click on DRAM.lnk
4. Select "Pin to taskbar"

METHOD 3: Drag and drop
------------------------
1. Hold Shift and right-click on DRAM.exe
2. Select "Copy as path"
3. Right-click on taskbar
4. Select "Toolbars" > "New toolbar..."
5. Paste the path and select the DRAM folder

NOTE: Since DRAM is a portable app, Windows may show multiple icons
when running. This is normal behavior for portable applications.
To avoid this, use METHOD 2 (shortcut) for the cleanest experience.
